This course introduces students to the notion of equilibrium for a market and market economy. The properties of such equilibria are explored, both in terms of model logic (existence, uniqueness) as well as in terms of the desirability of the equilibrium outcomes (efficiency, welfare).

 {"courseId":13562, "courseCode":"ECON 451", "courseName":"Law and Economics", "courseDescription":"Legal rules and jurisprudence can have a significant effect on resource allocation.
